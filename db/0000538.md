Forceful Deletion Via Malware Signature Embedding
=================================================

It is a known fact that anti-malware agents quarantine files that match signatures of known malware samples.

Therefore, by embedding a string which maches a known malware sample, one can forcefully delete files where the injected string is present.

This technique can be useful not only to hide tracks by wiping out log files but also to cause Denial of Service.
