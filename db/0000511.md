Traffic Forwarding on Mac OS X
==============================

The following command can be used to forward all traffic on port 80 to the localhost port 8080. This is useful for setting up transparent proxies, etc.

```sh
$ echo "rdr pass inet proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080" | sudo pfctl -ef -
```

You may have to forward all IP traffic if arp spoofing for example:

```sh
$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
$ sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=1
```

Additionally you may also need to setup a NAT rule like this:

```sh
$ echo "nat on en0 from en1 to any -> (en0)" | sudo pfctl -ef -
```
